			<h3>What to know</h3>
			<p>You do not need to know Jesus to hear from Him. Before I became Christian, God spoke to me out of the blue one day. I was at my lowest and did'nt know it. It woke me up.</p>

			<h3>What Ways Does God Speak</h3>

			<p> Have you ever had a thought before? That's where it starts, a thought. God can give you idea or speak to you without audibly shouting it at you and then you get abducted by Him. That's rare.</p>

			<p>Before I start, I want to tell you there is a being along with his minions in the spiritual realm that has sometimes posed himself as God and deceived me sometimes. It's the devil..but you knew that right? Tadah. The reason for all this mess. </p>

			<p>Jesus said, "My Sheep know my voice and to another they won't listen too." And "I am the door for my Sheep." So God will guide you to hear His voice.</p>

			<p> To hear God sometimes it's easier to get quite and still and ask for him to seek. If you get a thought, pay attention and press in. Seek to understand the idea or ask Him a question and wait for a answer.</p>

			<p>It's interesting that I'm writting over the Constitution with a lesson on hearing God's voice. Thats Prophetic or Him speaking write there. He will use anything to speak to you. No coincidences.</p>

			<h3>Lessons to consider.</h3>

			<p>
				
				Hearing the voice of Jesus is a deep spiritual aspiration for many Christians, offering guidance, comfort, and connection with the divine. While hearing Jesus may not always be a literal auditory experience, believers can perceive his presence and voice through various practices such as reading scripture, engaging in prayer and meditation, participating in worship, and observing the divine in daily life.</p>
				
				<p>Understanding scripture stands as a central way to hear Jesus speak. The Bible, particularly the New Testament, contains Jesus' teachings and acts as a foundational text for Christians. By studying these scriptures, believers can uncover the wisdom and messages Jesus offers. Contextual understanding of the parables, sermons, and conversations within the Gospels allows individuals to glean insights into Jesus’ voice and discern how his teachings apply to their lives today. In reflecting on biblical stories, Christians can feel as though Jesus is speaking directly through his timeless guidance.</p>
				<p>Prayer and meditation also create spaces for hearing Jesus’ voice. Engaging in heartfelt prayer involves more than offering petitions; it includes listening with an open heart. Through contemplative prayer and meditation, believers reflect on Jesus' life and words, attuning themselves to his presence. This spiritual discipline encourages silence and focus, allowing individuals to set aside distractions and perceive the still, small voice of Jesus resonating within them. Many find that dedicating time to prayer and meditation helps foster a deeper spiritual connection.</p>
				
				<p> in worship and community plays a vital role in hearing Jesus. Gatherings with fellow believers, whether in church services or small groups, offer a supportive environment where Jesus' teachings are shared and explored collectively. Through sermons, Bible study, communal prayer, and singing, Christians may experience Jesus’ voice expressed through the insights and encouragement of others. This communal aspect strengthens faith and attunes individuals to hearing Jesus within the context of a faith community.</p>
				
				<p>Finally, observing the presence of Jesus in everyday life helps believers hear his voice amid the ordinary. Many Christians find that Jesus speaks through acts of kindness, moments of gratitude, and personal challenges. By cultivating an awareness of God’s work in the world, believers learn to recognize Jesus’ influence throughout their life’s journeys. This practice involves reflecting on daily experiences and being mindful of the ways Jesus might be guiding them through others or through the circumstances they encounter.</p>
				
				<p>conclusion, hearing Jesus speak involves a combination of scriptural study, prayer, communal worship, and mindfulness of his presence in everyday life. These approaches enable believers to discern Jesus’ voice in their spiritual and daily existence. By remaining open and receptive, Christians deepen their relationship with Jesus, fostering a closer connection to his teachings and presence in their lives.</p>
				<p>God Love's us because we are one with Him. How could He ever treat us lesser than how expects all Creation sees Him in reverence to Himself, God. We are a piece of God, Himself. We are little gods of Himself. Everyone is a difference manifestation of God. We don't even know what God is, really. People toss His name around like they know Him. No, God is  very alien. He is not from Earth. So He knows our address and how to talk to us. </p>
