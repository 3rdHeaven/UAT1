//Requirements

Create a new webpage called game.html
Add a button to the game.html program to play a game.
You can choose a game of your own (NOT guess a number) or use the rules below to implement at least one random #, some math, conditionals (if/else if/else), and have all the output go the web page from the .js through the use of “.innerhtml “in the javascript.
In a separate code.js page, write a function to implement the game (the function called when the button is clicked)
Comment the function to describe what it does.
Create another function that takes a parameter and uses this input value and outputs results.
Comment almost every line of HTML and JavaScript code demonstrating you know what it does.
Link the .js file to the main HTML file.
Test the program and insure it works properly.
Add a great User Experience, Turn this into Quarks Casino or your choice – make it your own!
